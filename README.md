# Optimisation Visualisation

A personal project for visualising common optimisation methods on common test functions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).

When taking my optimisation module in university, I found a lack of visualisation resources. Hence, I made this interactive website that displays how common
optimisation methods work on different objective functions; hopefully this provides a nice way to demonstrate different optimisation methods for users first
learning about mathematical optimisation.

This project also serves teach me
